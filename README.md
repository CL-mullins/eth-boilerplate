Creating a standard boilerplate for an Ethereum smart contract

# What is a 'Smart Contract'?
A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network.

# What does this do?

Includes tests run locally by generating a new local network soley for the purpose of testing the contract. The tests are created using the Ganache library (previously called TestRPC). Ganache is used with a provider to interface with the Web3 network.
